'''
6. Write and test a program that computes the area of a circle.
   This program should request a number representing a radius 
   as input from the user. It should use the formula 
   3.14 * radius ** 2 to compute the area and then output 
   this result suitably labeled.
'''
# get radius of the circle
r = float(input ("Enter the radius of the circle : "))
print (f"The area of the circle with radius {r} is: {3.14 * r**2}")
