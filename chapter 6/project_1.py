  1.	Package Newtonâ€™s method for approximating square roots 
  (Case Study 3.6) in a function named newton. This function expects 
  the input number as an argument and returns the estimate of its square 
  root. The script should also include a main function that allows the user 
  to compute square roots of inputs until she presses the enter/return key
'''


'''
Compute the square root of a number. 
1. The input is a number. 
2. The outputs are the program's estimate of the square root
using Newton's method of successive approximations, and
Python's own estimate using math.sqrt. '''

import math # Receive the input number from the user
x = float(input("Enter a positive number: "))
# Initialize the tolerance and estimate
tolerance = 0.000001
estimate = 1.0
# Perform the successive approximations
while True:
    estimate = (estimate + x / estimate) / 2
    difference = abs(x - estimate ** 2)
    if difference <= tolerance:
        break
# Output the result
print("The program's estimate:", estimate)
print("Python's estimate:	", math.sqrt(x))
