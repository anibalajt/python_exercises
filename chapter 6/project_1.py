  1.	Package Newtonâ€™s method for approximating square roots
  (Case Study 3.6) in a function named newton. This function expects
  the input number as an argument and returns the estimate of its square
  root. The script should also include a main function that allows the user
  to compute square roots of inputs until she presses the enter/return key
